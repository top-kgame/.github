# 🎮 Welcome to top-kgame

We are building a **modular, high-performance game server ecosystem** entirely in **Java**. 

Our goal is to provide a robust set of decoupled core libraries that simplify the complexities of modern game server development.

### 🛠 Core Components (Under Active Development)
- **[GServerECS](https://github.com/top-kgame/GServerECS)**: A lightweight and high-performance Entity-Component-System framework tailored for server-side logic.
- **[JSnapSync](https://github.com/top-kgame/JSnapSync)**: A specialized library for high-frequency snapshot synchronization and state management.
- **Game Server Template**: (Coming soon) A scalable server bootstrap integrating our core libraries.

### 🚧 Project Status
This project is currently in the **active development phase**. We are focusing on refining the core architecture and ensuring thread safety and performance for high-concurrency gaming environments.
